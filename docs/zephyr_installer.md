## Zephyr Installer

The `zephyr_installer.py` script is used to automatically generate Zephyr board support package based on the provided System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and Board information from the soc.h file generated by efinity

The script does the following:

- Reads the provided soc.h file and identifies the available IP modules and configurations.
- Creates a new SoC and board and it's associated configuration files in Zephyr

### Usage

The script requires the following mandatory arguments:

- `soc_name`: Name of the System-on-a-Chip (SoC).
- `board_name`: Name of the Board in Zephyr.
- `efx_dev_board`: Development kit name (e.g. ti60).
- `zephyr_path`: Path to the Zephyr project.
- `soc_h_path`: Path to the soc.h file.

Here is an example of how to run the script:

```
python3 zephyr_installer.py {soc_name} {board_name} {efx_dev_board} {zephyr_path} {soc_h_path}
```

Replace the {...} placeholders with your actual values.

For example, if your SoC name is "my_soc", board name is "my_board", development kit name is "ti60", the Zephyr path is "/path/to/zephyr_project" and soc.h path is "/path/to/soc.h", you would run:

```
python3 zephyr_installer.py my_soc my_board ti60 /path/to/zephyr_project /path/to/soc.h
```
